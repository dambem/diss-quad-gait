%However, the following experiment showcases that this may be partly due to similarity breaking down.
The entire dataset of values of relative stride length against Froude number have a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.599, suggesting  positive correalation
between stride length and relative Froude number.
However, this may be mostly due to oscillator time-step, as oscillator time-step against Froude number contain the same pearson correlation coefficient.
 The results found in this experiment showcase an extremely tangential nature between relative stride length and oscillator time-step.

A possible reason as to why unrealistic gaits may be generated is due to the difference found between  imaginary coupling and actual limb rotation. A paired t-test was ran between the imaginary oscillator and
transposed real limb rotation values. This found that smaller forces contained a low average p-value, (0.05), implying a close resemblance. However, this increased over time to an average of (0.10). This implies a rise in
difference between imaginary values and real values when force is increased, shown by a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.876. This did was not effected by oscillator time-step, which  had a pearson correlation value of
0.002, suggesting no strong correlation.

Oscillator Time-Step has been defined as the increment size for each time-step of the simulation. This can be related to time period of oscillations by the equation  period*(osc_imaginary_period)/pi =  pi/imaginary_period. This is
due to the simulated pybullet example running every 1/500 timesteps, and as such needs to be moved back to proper time-periods.
By using a paired t-test to find correlation between different oscillator values and the values found in Dynamic Similarity, we found fairly weak correlations between each individual time-step, however, when filtering

 However, the calculations for relative stride length have been estimated based on approximate amount of strides over time based on oscillator time step. This could be the cause for such a close link  between
 relative stride length and Froude number, as in figure \ref{} oscillator time-step has been shown to divide Froude number values.

The results found show that although a large number of generated gaits lie between correct values, the quadruped does not need to adhere to these evolutionary concepts, and
in many examples it can achieve far larger Froude numbers with walking gaits than is found in the wild. However, when using slower gaits, calculations of  Froude number provide
a good indication as to force and oscillator value required, and in a system that may have constraints for both, Froude number could provide an important estimate for parameters.
This would require further, more in-depth research with a real robot.

The main limitation of a quadrupeds speed in this research is through speed of limb rotation. This may have evolutionary limits in a real life robot, as well as constraints in motors
for a real robot. As not enough data has been found on the Laikago on maximum limb rotation, this dissertation has not been able to accurately simulate the same motors.

 One  issues with some calculations found in this dissertation is that Froude number has been estimated based on the 3D model found, as a full specification for the Laikago
 was unavailable. However, this
 A potential drawback of this research was the number of gaits found at extremely low values above zero. As we cannot t

 The implementation of sinusidal forcing could be more effective at finding appropriate time-period values, and could effect the results of the experiment in a more positive way.
