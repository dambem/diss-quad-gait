abstract = {Designing an actuator system for highly dynamic legged robots has been one of the grand challenges in robotics research. Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability. We introduce a new metric named the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.},

@article{Stein1997,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the concept of cursoriality in mammals and aims to point out the confusion that can arise when a classical tern1 is not explicitly redefined or expanded to incorporate the results of biomechanical techniques. Historically, the definition of ‘cursorial' was based qualitatively on an animal's morphology and behaviour, generally referring to large, terrestrial mammals that ran fast or far across open spaces. However, in recent years, as biomechanicists have learned how to quantify aspects of limb movement and bone orientation, a more specific meaning of this term has come into use. Results from these new techniques have highlighted the lack of specificity in the historical definition and have led us to propose a clarified, quantitative definition of ‘cursorial'. The exceptional nature of bovids and primates with respect to this new definition is also addressed in our analysis. We recognize that the definition we propose is, itself, not sufficient because it cannot be applied to fossil taxa and because kinematic data are still lacking for many taxa. Hence, we look forward to the eventual adoption of an even more expanded definition or suite of terms that will further distinguish between all attributes of cursorial mammals and that will reflect an increased understanding of their evolutionary origins.

abstract = {It is understood gait has the potential to be used as a window into neurodegenerative disorders, identify markers of subclinical pathology, inform diagnostic algorithms of disease progression and measure the efficacy of interventions. Dogs' gaits are frequently assessed in a veterinary setting to detect signs of lameness. Despite this, a reliable, affordable and objective method to assess lameness in dogs is lacking. Most described canine lameness assessments are subjective, unvalidated and at high risk of bias. This means reliable, early detection of canine gait abnormalities is challenging, which may have detrimental implications for dogs' welfare. In this paper, we draw from approaches and technologies used in human movement science and describe a system for objectively measuring temporal gait characteristics in dogs (step-time, swing-time, stance-time). Asymmetries and variabilities in these characteristics are of known clinical significance when assessing lameness but presently may only be assessed on coarse scales or under highly instrumented environments. The system consists an inertial measurement unit, containing a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope coupled with a standardized walking course. The measurement unit is attached to each leg of the dog under assessment before it is walked around the course. The data by the measurement unit is then processed to identify steps and subsequently, micro-gait characteristics. This method has been tested on a cohort of 19 healthy dogs of various breeds ranging in height from 34.2 cm to 84.9 cm. We report the system as capable of making precise step delineations with detections of initial and final contact times of foot-to-floor to a mean precision of 0.011 s and 0.048 s, respectively. Results are based on analysis of 12,678 foot falls and we report a sensitivity, positive predictive value and F-score of 0.81, 0.83 and 0.82 respectively. To investigate the effect of gait on system performance, the approach was tested in both walking and trotting with no significant performance deviation with 7249 steps reported for a walking gait and 4977 for a trotting gait. The number of steps reported for each leg were approximately equal and this consistency was true in both walking and trotting gaits. In the walking gait 1965, 1790, 1726 and 1768 steps were reported for the front left, front right, hind left and hind right legs respectively. 1361, 1250, 1176 and 1190 steps were reported for each of the four legs in the trotting gait. The proposed system is a pragmatic and precise solution for obtaining objective measurements of canine gait. With further development, it promises potential for a wide range of applications in both research and clinical practice.},

abstract = {The dynamic similarity hypothesis postulates that different mammals move in a dynamically similar fashion whenever they travel at speeds that give them equal values of a dimensionless parameter, the Froude number. Thus, given information about one species, it could be possible to predict for others relationships between size, speed and features of gait such as stride length, duty factor, the phase relationships of the feet and the patterns of force exerted on the ground. Data for a diverse sample of mammals have been used to test the hypothesis. It is found to be tenable in many cases when comparisons are confined to quadrupedal mammals of the type described by Jenkins (1971) as "cursorial". Most mammals of mass greater than 5 kg are of this type. Although the hypothesis applies less successfully to comparisons between cursorial and non-cursorial mammals it is shown to be a reasonable approximation even for such comparisons and for comparisons between quadrupedal mammals and bipedal mammals and birds.},

abstract = {Although a large number of foot-fall sequences are possible in quadrupeds, few sequences are routinely used. The aim of this paper is to characterise, by foot-fall pattern, the gaits used by horses and develop a novel technique to classify symmetric and asymmetric gaits using one common criterion. To achieve this speed and relative foot-fall, timings of all four limbs of eight Icelandic horses were measured using accelerometers. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to find criteria that are optimal for discriminating between the different gaits. This also allowed us to evaluate whether gaits should be considered a continuum or as discrete entities. Foot-fall timings (stance times, swing times, duty factors and stride frequencies) for walk, tolt, trot, pace, left canter, right canter, left gallop and right gallop during over-ground locomotion at a range of speeds are presented. In the gaits of walk, tolt, trot and pace, foot-fall timings were equal between left and right hindlimbs and forelimbs so these gaits can be considered as symmetrical. Differences in stance times and duty factors were observed between gaits but are unlikely to be of biological significance due to their similar magnitude and inconsistent relative trends. This implies that metabolics or peak limb forces derived from contact times are unlikely to be the principal driving factors in gait transition between walk, trot, pace, canters and gallops, although these factors may influence the use of tolt at the lower and higher speeds. Gaits did cluster in the LDA space and the running gaits (tolt, trot, pace, left and right canters and gallops) could be considered a kinematic continuum but the relative relationship with walk may be more complex. Thus, LDA analysis has enabled common criteria to be discovered to accurately classify equine gaits on the basis of foot-fall timings on a stride-by-stride basis.},

abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) are becoming a popular model for the control of locomotion of legged robots. Biological CPGs are neural networks responsible for the generation of rhythmic movements, especially locomotion. In robotics, a systematic way of designing such CPGs as artificial neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators with sensory feedback inclusion is still missing. In this contribution, we present a way of designing CPGs with coupled oscillators in which we can independently control the ascending and descending phases of the oscillations (i.e. the swing and stance phases of the limbs). Using insights from dynamical system theory, we construct generic networks of oscillators able to generate several gaits under simple parameter changes. Then we introduce a systematic way of adding sensory feedback from touch sensors in the CPG such that the controller is strongly coupled with the mechanical system it controls. Finally we control three different simulated robots (iCub, Aibo and Ghostdog) using the same controller to show the effectiveness of the approach. Our simulations prove the importance of independent control of swing and stance duration. The strong mutual coupling between the CPG and the robot allows for more robust locomotion, even under non precise parameters and non-flat environment.},

General principles of the organization of these circuits and their control by higher brain centers have come from the study of smaller circuits found in invertebrates. Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuromodulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

In addition, users can provide an open loop reference to guide the learning process when more control over the learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identification, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

abstract = {In this work we research the role of body dynamics in the complexity of kinematic patterns in a quadruped robot with compliant legs. Two gait patterns, lateral sequence walk and trot, along with leg length control patterns of different complexity were implemented in a modular, feed-forward locomotion controller. The controller was tested on a small, quadruped robot with compliant, segmented leg design, and led to self-stable and self-stabilizing robot locomotion. In-air stepping and on-ground locomotion leg kinematics were recorded, and the number and shapes of motion primitives accounting for 95{\%} of the variance of kinematic leg data were extracted. This revealed that kinematic patterns resulting from feed-forward control had a lower complexity (in-air stepping, 2-3 primitives) than kinematic patterns from on-ground locomotion ($\nu$m4 primitives), although both experiments applied identical motor patterns. The complexity of on-ground kinematic patterns had increased, through ground contact and mechanical entrainment. The complexity of observed kinematic on-ground data matches those reported from level-ground locomotion data of legged animals. Results indicate that a very low complexity of modular, rhythmic, feed-forward motor control is sufficient for level-ground locomotion in combination with passive compliant legged hardware.},

abstract = {Humans and animals are believed to use a very minimal set of trajectories to perform a wide variety of tasks including walking. Our main objective in this paper is two fold 1) Obtain an effective tool to realize these basic motion patterns for quadrupedal walking, called the kinematic motion primitives (kMPs), via trajectories learned from deep reinforcement learning (D-RL) and 2) Realize a set of behaviors, namely trot, walk, gallop and bound from these kinematic motion primitives in our custom four legged robot, called the `Stoch'. D-RL is a data driven approach, which has been shown to be very effective for realizing all kinds of robust locomotion behaviors, both in simulation and in experiment. On the other hand, kMPs are known to capture the underlying structure of walking and yield a set of derived behaviors. We first generate walking gaits from D-RL, which uses policy gradient based approaches. We then analyze the resulting walking by using principal component analysis. We observe that the kMPs extracted from PCA followed a similar pattern irrespective of the type of gaits generated. Leveraging on this underlying structure, we then realize walking in Stoch by a straightforward reconstruction of joint trajectories from kMPs. This type of methodology improves the transferability of these gaits to real hardware, lowers the computational overhead on-board, and also avoids multiple training iterations by generating a set of derived behaviors from a single learned gait.},

We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning.

abstract = {A comparative study of quantitative kinematic data of fore- and hindlimb movements of eight different mammalian species leads to the recognition of basic principles in the locomotion of small therians. The description of kinematics comprises fore- and hindlimb movements as well as sagittal spine movements including displacement patterns of limb segments, their contribution to step length, and joint movements. The comparison of the contributions of different segments to step length clearly shows the proximal parts (scapula, femur) to produce more than half of the propulsive movement of the whole limb at symmetrical gaits. Basically, a three-segmented limb with zigzag configuration of segments is mainly displaced at the scapular pivot or hip joint, both of which have the same vertical distance to the ground. Two segments operate in matched motion during retraction of the limb. While kinematic parameters of forelimbs are independent of speed and gait (with the scapula as the dominant element), fundamental changes occur in hindlimb kinematics with the change from symmetrical to in-phase gaits. Forward motion of the hindlimbs is now mainly due to sagittal lumbar spine movements contributing to half of the step length. Kinematics of small therian mammals are independent of their systematic position, their natural habitat, and also of specific anatomical dispositions (e.g. reduction of fingers, toes, or clavicle). In contrast, the possession of a tail influences 'pelvic movements'.},

abstract = {Crawling on hands and knees is an early pattern of human infant locomotion, which offers an interesting way of studying quadrupedalism in one of its simplest form. We investigate how crawling human infants compare to other quadruped mammals, especially primates. We present quantitative data on both the gait and kinematics of seven 10-month-old crawling infants. Body movements were measured with an optoelectronic system giving precise data on 3-dimensional limb movements. Crawling on hands and knees is very similar to the locomotion of non-human primates in terms of the quite protracted arm at touch-down, the coordination between the spine movements in the lateral plane and the limbs, the relatively extended limbs during locomotion and the strong correlation between stance duration and speed of locomotion. However, there are important differences compared to primates, such as the choice of a lateral-sequence walking gait, which is similar to most non-primate mammals and the relatively stiff elbows during stance as opposed to the quite compliant gaits of primates. These finding raise the question of the role of both the mechanical structure of the body and neural control on the determination of these characteristics.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. A selection of results using our method for quadruped animation. We show some different modes for sitting, turning trot, pace, canter, jumping and standing from left to right. The locomotion gaits are not labeled individually, but naturally produced by the movement velocity control. Quadruped motion includes a wide variation of gaits such as walk, pace, trot and canter, and actions such as jumping, sitting, turning and idling. Applying existing data-driven character control frameworks to such data requires a significant amount of data preprocessing such as motion labeling and alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture called Mode-Adaptive Neural Networks for controlling quadruped charac-ters. The system is composed of the motion prediction network and the gating network. At each frame, the motion prediction network computes the character state in the current frame given the state in the previous frame and the user-provided control signals. The gating network dynamically updates the weights of the motion prediction network by selecting and blending what we call the expert weights, each of which specializes in a particular movement. Due to the increased flexibility, the system can learn consistent expert weights across a wide range of non-periodic/periodic actions, from unstructured motion capture data, in an end-to-end fashion. In addition, the users are released from performing complex labeling of phases in different gaits. We show that this architecture is suitable for encoding the multi-modality of quadruped locomotion and synthesizing responsive motion in real-time.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that hind limb proportions may be used to predict locomotor performance in a sample of 49 species of primarily cursorial mamals. Data on maximal sprint running speeds taken from published sources were related to measurements of hind limb lengths. To control for statistical complications due to the hierarchical nature of phylogenetic relationships, we used Felsenstein's (1985) independent contrasts method for analysing comparative data, and a composite phylogeny for all 49 species, based on a variety of published sources. The independent contrasts method indicates that maximal running speed does not covary significantly with body mass for this sample of mammals (mass range= 2.5–2,000 kg). Even though quality of the available speed data is highly variable, both metatarsal/femur ratio—the traditional index of ‘cursoriality' in mammals—and hind limb length (corrected for body size) are significant predictors of maximal running speed. When only fully curorial species are included in the analyses (n = 32), hind limb length still significantly predicts speed (r2= 16{\%}), but MT/F ratio does not. Although ungulates tend to have larger MT/F ratios than do Carnivora, they are not generally faster; relatonships between speed and limb proportions within the two clades show no significant differences. These and previous results suggest that hind limb proportions and maximal running speed may not have evolved in a tightly coupled fashion. Prediction of locomotor performance of extinct forms, based solely on their limb proportions, should be undertaken with caution.},

Additionally, all gaits transitioned according to speed, as seen in animals. We have therefore hypothesized that various gaits derive from a trot because of posture control through leg loading feedback. The body tilt on the two support legs of each diagonal pair during trotting was classified into three types (level, tilted up, or tilted down) according to speed. The load difference between the two legs led to the phase difference between their CPGs via the loading feedbacks, resulting in nine gaits (3(2): three tilts to the power of two diagonal pairs) including the aforementioned.},

INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION provides a mathematical treatment of computation theory grounded in theorems and proofs. Proofs are presented with a "proof idea" component to reveal the concepts underpinning the formalism. Algorithms are presented using prose instead of pseudocode to focus attention on the algorithms themselves, rather than on specific computational models. Topic coverage, terminology, and order of presentation are traditional for an upper-level course in computer science theory. Users of the Preliminary Edition (now out of print) will be interested to note several new chapters on complexity theory: Chapter 8 on space complexity; Chapter 9 on provable intractability, and Chapter 10 on advanced topics, including approximation algorithms, alternation, interactive proof systems, cryptography, and parallel computing."--Publisher's description.},

abstract = {The rate of stepping in the hind legs of chronic spinal and decerebrate cats adapts to the speed of the treadmill on which the animals walk. This adaptive behavior depends on sensory signals generated near the end of stance phase controlling the transition from stance to swing. Two sensory signals have been identified to have this role: one from afferents activated by hip extension, most likely arising from muscle spindles in hip flexor muscles, and the other from group Ib afferents from Golgi tendon organs in the ankle extensor muscles. The relative importance of these two signals in controlling the stance to swing transition differs in chronic spinal cats and in decerebrate cats. Activation of hip afferents is necessary for controlling the transition in chronic spinal cats but not in decerebrate cats, while reduction in activity in group Ib afferents from GTOs is the primary factor controlling the transition in decerebrate cats. Possible mechanisms for this difference are discussed. The extent to which these two sensory signals control the stance to swing transition in normal walking cats is unknown, but it is likely that both could play an important role when animals are walking in a variable environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Animal locomotion is generated and control- led, in part, by a central pattern generator (CPG), which is an intraspinal network of neurons capable of pro- ducing rhythmic output. In the present work, it is demon- strated that a hard-wired CPG model, made up of four coupled nonlinear oscillators, can produce multiple phase-locked oscillation patterns that correspond to three common quadrupedal gaits - the walk, trot, and bound. Transitions between the different gaits are gener- ated by varying the network's driving signal and/or by altering internal oscillator parameters. The above in numero results are obtained without changing the relative strengths or the polarities of the system's synap- tic interconnections, i.e., the network maintains an in- variant coupling architecture. It is also shown that the ability of the hard-wired CPG network to produce and switch between multiple gait patterns is a model-inde- pendent phenomenon, i.e., it does not depend upon the detailed dynamics of the component oscillators and/or the nature of the inter-oscillator coupling. Three different neuronal oscillator models - the Stein neuronal model, the Van der Pol oscillator, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model - and two different coupling schemes are incorp- orated into the network without impeding its ability to produce the three quadrupedal gaits and the aforemen- tioned gait transitions.},

abstract = {Only a few studies on quadrupedal locomotion have investigated symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits in the same framework because the mechanisms underlying these two types of gait seem to be different and it took a long time to identify a common set of parameters for their simultaneous study. Moreover, despite the clear importance of the spatial dimension in animal locomotion, the relationship between temporal and spatial limb coordination has never been quantified before. We used anteroposterior sequence (APS) analysis to analyse 486 sequences from five malinois (Belgian shepherd) dogs moving at a large range of speeds (from 0.4 to 10.0 m s(-1)) to compare symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits through kinematic and limb coordination parameters. Considerable continuity was observed in cycle characteristics, from walk to rotary gallop, but at very high speeds an increase in swing duration reflected the use of sagittal flexibility of the vertebral axis to increase speed. This change occurred after the contribution of the increase in stride length had become the main element driving the increase in speed - i.e. when the dogs had adopted asymmetrical gaits. As the left and right limbs of a pair are linked to the same rigid structure, spatial coordination within pairs of limbs reflected the temporal coordination within pairs of limbs whatever the speed. By contrast, the relationship between the temporal and spatial coordination between pairs of limb was found to depend on speed and trunk length. For trot and rotary gallop, this relationship was thought also to depend on the additional action of trunk flexion and leg angle at footfall.},

Our approach is based on a hybrid optimization method which combines an efficient derivative-aware spacetime constraints optimization with a derivative-free approach able to find non-local solutions in high-dimensional discontinuous spaces.

Each leg has two degrees of freedom - knee and hip joint can be actuated using proximal mounted RC servo motors, force transmission to the knee is achieved by means of a bowden cable mechanism. Simple electronics to command the actuators from a desktop computer have been designed in order to test the robot. A Central Pattern Generator (CPG) network has been implemented to generate different gaits. A parameter space search was performed and tested on the robot to optimize forward velocity.},

abstract = {We quantify the accuracy of various simulators compared to a real world robotic reaching and interaction task. Simulators are used in robotics to design solutions for real world hardware without the need for physical access. The `reality gap' prevents solutions developed or learnt in simulation from performing well, or at at all, when transferred to real-world hardware. Making use of a Kinova robotic manipulator and a motion capture system, we record a ground truth enabling comparisons with various simulators, and present quantitative data for various manipulation-oriented robotic tasks. We show the relative strengths and weaknesses of numerous contemporary simulators, highlighting areas of significant discrepancy, and assisting researchers in the field in their selection of appropriate simulators for their use cases.

@article{Maes2013,
abstract = {Quadrupedal locomotion is the result of complex interactions between biomechanical and neural systems. During steady gaits, both systems are in stable states. When the animal changes its speed, transitions between gaits can occur in which the different coordination parameters are dissociated. Consequently, transitions are the periods where it is possible to detect and identify those parameters involved in the mechanical or neural control of locomotion. We studied interlimb coordination using a sequential method (antero-posterior sequence) to measure the footfall patterns of dogs when accelerating and decelerating from 1.5 m s(-1) to more than 6 m s(-1) and back. We obtained 383 transitions between all the symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits used by the dogs. Analysis of the interlimb coordination modifications and of each foot parameter showed that mechanics drive the stance phase whereas coordination is controlled during the swing phase. Furthermore, comparison of the transition patterns between all gaits reveals the modular organization of locomotion: a pectoral module coordinates the two forelimbs, a pelvic module coordinates the two hindlimbs and an axial module coordinates the two pairs of limbs and the trunk motion. The three modules cooperate to give rise to a template of stable interlimb coordination pattern, such as walk, trot or gallop.},

@article{Low2006,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a simple system of coupled oscillators as a model of pattern generation for jellyfish locomotion. Coupled oscillator models have been successfully applied to model pattern generation in numerous biological systems including jellyfish locomotion, but the previous jellyfish models have required complicated oscillators or variation of coupling topology to produce gait variations. Here we show that a simple model consisting of identical van der Pol oscillators with fixed coupling topology suffices to produce dynamics corresponding to essential jellyfish gaits (co-ordinated bout swimming, hovering, and turning) solely by uniform adjustment of coupling strengths. Thus, a simple coupled oscillator model succeeds in producing a range of dynamic behaviour analogous to the essential neural dynamics for locomotion control of a simple animal.

@article{Ijspeert2008,
abstract = {The problem of controlling locomotion is an area in which neuroscience and robotics can fruitfully interact. In this article, I will review research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only simple, low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
